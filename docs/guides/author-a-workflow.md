# Author a Workflow

A Workflow definition is a reusable team contract. Start from a packaged Starter, name responsibilities rather than phases, then validate and publish an immutable revision.

## Start in the Console

The fastest path is:

1. Open **Workflows** and choose the Starter closest to the work.
2. Open it for editing. Oh My Subagents creates or resumes a draft while the current published revision remains available for runs.
3. Give every Member one distinct responsibility and a clear boundary.
4. Validate the complete draft.
5. Publish only when the preview and validation findings match the intended team.

For example, `production-feature-delivery` separates product and contract decisions, service and experience delivery, integration, and independent verification. That separation is the product value: one Member does not silently define, implement, approve, and verify the same claim.

Connections in the team tree describe responsibility and delegation ownership, not time. Array order does not schedule work. At runtime, a Manager can choose sequential, parallel, iterative, batch, or hybrid assignments from the prompt and current evidence.

## Draft with the Operator

Ask the separate Operator for a team in ordinary language:

> Create a Workflow draft for a cross-layer feature. Keep the shared contract,
> service implementation, user experience, and integration verification under
> distinct ownership.

The Operator may ask a typed clarification, then create and edit the controller-owned draft. “Create a Workflow” authorizes drafting only. It does not authorize publication or starting a run.

The Operator has exact Workflow draft operations; it does not have generic file editing or filesystem authority. Review the resulting draft in the Console, validate it, and give an explicit publish instruction when it is ready.

You can also supply a strong Workflow as a structural reference. The Operator should preserve useful responsibility and review boundaries while adapting the tree, not copy its prose or repeat generic Task-member rules. If you request an explicit Codex model, the Operator uses the current provider-reported choices returned by authoring options; when that catalog is unavailable, it leaves the model unset so the configured default applies.

## Write strong responsibilities

Use these tests for every Member:

- **Distinct:** another Member does not own the same decision or edit surface.
- **Necessary:** removing the responsibility would weaken the result.
- **Bounded:** the Member can tell what it owns and what it must return.
- **Reviewable:** another responsibility can challenge consequential claims without erasing ownership.

Keep the Workflow focused on reusable responsibility. Put the specific outcome, local constraints, and optional file references in the run prompt.

## Understand publication and currentness

Draft edits use controller-owned currentness checks so a stale browser or Operator turn cannot silently overwrite newer work. The Console handles these checks and offers current legal actions; reload before retrying a conflicted change.

Publishing creates an immutable Workflow revision and makes it current for new runs. It does not mutate older revisions or existing runs. Every Task pins the exact published revision selected at start. Later changes require a new draft and publication.

Validation proves the draft's current authoring rules. It is not publication and does not prove that a future provider route, Human Request, Command Run, or run start will be legal.

Choose **Export YAML** in Workflow Studio to download the draft exactly as it currently appears, including edits still waiting for autosave. Export is always available while the draft is open and does not save, validate, or publish anything. Finish **Add member** first if a new Member should appear in the file; an unfinished local Member form is not part of the Workflow yet.

## Add advanced choices deliberately

Installed Starters omit providers so they work with the installation default. They demonstrate only narrow built-in capability grants on responsibilities that need user decisions or durable process supervision. Add or remove advanced fields only when the responsibility requires them:

```yaml
provider:
    kind: codex
    model: gpt-5.6
    effort: high
    sandbox:
        mode: workspace_write
        network: deny
    extension_mode: isolated
capabilities:
    human_request:
        - direction
        - approval
    command_run: allow
```

Provider and capability choices apply to that Member; children do not inherit them. Codex and Claude support managed model, effort, sandbox, network, and Skill/MCP mode choices. Choose `inherit` when a trusted, full-access Member should use enabled user and project Skills plus MCP servers already configured in that provider. Choose `isolated` for an exact Oh My Subagents-only extension surface. Oh My Subagents automatically isolates narrower sandbox or network-denied execution, so the Workflow stays portable instead of failing validation. Implicit workspace instructions, plugins, hooks, apps, and provider subagents remain disabled.

Codex accepts `max` reasoning for Task Members. Native Codex settings that Oh My Subagents does not override, such as `service_tier = "fast"`, continue to apply.

Human Request kinds are `input`, `direction`, `approval`, and `review`. Command Run is a separate allow-or-deny capability. Both deny when omitted. Grant the smallest capability to the Member that owns the decision or managed command.

The three maintained advanced references make different boundaries explicit:

- [advanced reviewed code change](../../examples/workflows/advanced-reviewed-code-change.yaml);
- [advanced cross-layer delivery](../../examples/workflows/advanced-cross-layer-delivery.yaml); and
- [advanced technical decision](../../examples/workflows/advanced-technical-decision.yaml).

Review their exact provider and access assumptions in the [Workflow catalog](../../examples/workflows/README.md) before importing one.

## Use JSON or YAML when needed

The Console and Operator use the same closed Workflow model exposed by the public [definition reference](../reference/workflows/README.md) and [JSON Schema](../reference/workflows/workflow-definition.schema.yaml). YAML is convenient for maintained files; JSON is the structured HTTP and Operator shape.

Import a complete YAML or JSON definition as a draft:

```bash
oms workflow import --file ./team.yaml
```

Standard input requires an explicit format:

```bash
oms workflow import --file - --format json < team.json
```

Replacing an existing draft requires its current opaque ETag:

```bash
oms workflow import --file ./team.yaml --etag '<current-etag>'
```

Import never publishes. Export the current published revision with:

```bash
oms workflow export team-id --output ./team-id.yaml
```
