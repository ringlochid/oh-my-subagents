# Package and reset

Status: Reference

This page owns distribution contents, installed verification, exact schema admission, and destructive reset.

## Distribution boundary

`pyproject.toml` is the package contract. The distribution is `oh-my-subagents` at version `0.3.2`, the canonical console command is `oms`, the temporary compatibility command is `banksia`, and the canonical Python import package is `oh_my_subagents`. Python 3.12 or newer is required.

The built wheel contains:

- the `oh_my_subagents` backend import package, the two-file `banksia` launcher bridge, and canonical `oms` plus compatibility `banksia` entry points;
- the packaged Console assets;
- provider-neutral Starter Workflow resources;
- Task-member and Operator prompt assets; and
- the Oh My Subagents user-service template.

The native desktop host contract is:

- supported Linux distributions with the required Python and user systemd facilities, including WSL2 when its Linux filesystem/runtime capabilities pass the same admission checks; and
- macOS 13 or newer through the current-user LaunchAgent lane; and
- Windows 11 x64 on a local NTFS volume through the current-user Task Scheduler lane.

Windows UNC, network, device, non-NTFS, and reparse-point workspace paths are outside the native host contract. WSL2 remains the Linux lane. Provider routes on supported controller hosts remain governed by their pinned official integrations rather than a second Oh My Subagents OS allowlist. Host support additionally requires Oh My Subagents's workspace, private-path, Command Run, install, reset, and service proof; installing a provider wheel alone is not platform proof.

It contains no environment file, provider credential, Python cache, ignored research, source-only test fixture, request-pair file, or removed compatibility entry point.

`make package-build` builds and stages the Console, creates wheel and source distribution artifacts, and verifies their identity and contents. `make package-verify` rebuilds those artifacts and runs the complete installed candidate proof in a trapped temporary directory outside the repository. The verifier rejects an in-repository workspace and proves that the repository Git-exclude file remains byte-identical. A bare `python -m build` does not prove the packaged Console or installed behavior.

The installed-distribution verifier installs the wheel into a fresh virtual environment outside the repository and exercises imports, CLI, initialization, exact schema setup, provider configuration, Workflow bootstrap, Task start, server health/readiness, restart, and the isolated user-service command path.

## Release publication

The Linux compatibility workflow runs the repository static, unit, integration, documentation, Console, package-build, and installed-distribution gates on a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner. Windows and macOS retain their native compatibility workflows; one platform result never substitutes for another platform's owned boundary.

Release publication starts only from a pushed `v*` tag whose value exactly matches `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`. A manual workflow dispatch rehearses the same build and verification but cannot enter the publication job. The release workflow runs `make package-verify` and transfers only its wheel and source distribution through a GitHub Actions artifact. The separate publication job is bound to the `pypi` GitHub environment and authenticates with that environment's `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret. It does not tolerate an already-published filename.

The release operator must verify the exact tag, successful platform and release jobs, PyPI file hashes, and a clean-index installation before creating the final GitHub release. The GitHub release attaches the same PyPI distributions and their SHA-256 manifest. A failed build or publication job stops this sequence; it does not authorize rebuilding or replacing artifacts under the same version.

## Schema admission and forward upgrade

Startup and initialization create the schema only when the configured database is genuinely empty. Otherwise they compare the complete registered metadata contract with the selected SQLite database or dedicated PostgreSQL schema. Missing, unexpected, or changed tables, columns, keys, constraints, indexes, defaults, and computed expressions stop admission without issuing DDL. The CLI and raw foreground/background startup failure direct the operator to run `oms db upgrade` with the same configuration before considering destructive reset.

`oms db upgrade` applies only an explicitly registered, sequential Oh My Subagents schema upgrade whose complete starting-schema differences match the expected predecessor exactly. An unknown, skipped, partially changed, locally modified, or already-corrupt schema is never guessed or repaired. Every supported upgrade runs transactionally where the database supports transactional DDL, ends with the same complete exact-schema verifier used at startup, and preserves controller rows unless its named contract explicitly says otherwise.

Before an eligible upgrade changes an existing database, Oh My Subagents must create a backup or abort without DDL. SQLite uses an adjacent owner-private backup through SQLite's online backup facility and requires a successful integrity check. PostgreSQL uses `pg_dump` to create a nonempty custom-format archive of the dedicated Oh My Subagents schema under the configured data directory. The CLI reports the resulting path. PostgreSQL additionally keeps upgrade DDL in one transaction.

The first supported forward upgrade adds the Attempt watchdog replacement budget. Existing Attempts receive `0`, which grants one fresh recovery budget at the upgrade boundary, while historical Dispatches and every other controller record remain unchanged.

The next supported upgrade widens the closed Task Event type constraint for `member_steered` without rewriting event or Dispatch rows. A database that still needs both registered changes is recognized as one exact combined predecessor and receives both changes under one backup and verification transaction.

The next supported upgrade widens Command Run terminal exit codes to an unsigned-compatible 32-bit storage lane. PostgreSQL changes the column to `BIGINT` while preserving every Command Run row. SQLite `INTEGER` already stores signed 64-bit values, so existing SQLite databases need no table rewrite and remain exact under the SQLite type-affinity contract.

`oms migrate-from-banksia` is the sole legacy-state import path. It copies default local files without changing database rows or schema, preserves custom database locations and the configured PostgreSQL schema, and never weakens exact schema admission. Supported schema upgrades do not introduce dual runtime truth or acceptance of nonexact schemas.

Before default `oms init` writes anything, it checks for a legacy default config or SQLite database. When legacy state exists and no canonical config has been established, initialization stops and directs the operator to `oms migrate-from-banksia`. Explicit config, data, and database locations remain available for an intentionally separate controller. Migration validates every source and destination file before it copies any state or changes a native service, so a conflicting OMS file leaves both state trees and the legacy service untouched.

After schema creation or verification, bootstrap transactionally validates and publishes the packaged Starter Workflow set. Identical package-owned content is idempotent, and reseeding never replaces a user-authored current revision.

## Destructive reset

`oms db reset` is explicit destructive replacement:

- SQLite requires a configured file-backed database, rejects a symlinked or nonregular database, and removes only that file plus known regular/symlink sidecars before recreating the schema.
- PostgreSQL drops and recreates only the configured dedicated non-system schema and requires operator-assured exclusive ownership.
- Both backends recreate the exact schema and reseed Starter Workflows.

Before reset deletes a controller-owned Task root or replaces an existing database/schema, Oh My Subagents must create the same backup used by forward upgrade and report its path. Backup failure is a hard stop. A nonexistent SQLite database or PostgreSQL schema has nothing to preserve, so reset may initialize it without creating an empty backup artifact. PostgreSQL reset and upgrade therefore require a compatible `pg_dump` client on the controller host.

Reset may delete controller-owned Task roots recorded inside the configured data boundary. It deliberately preserves accepted workspace Task directories matching `.oms/t_<id>/` or the persisted legacy `.banksia/t_<id>/` shape; shared user workspaces and their loose files are never recursively deleted by database reset.

## Managed background service

`oms service install|start|stop|restart|status|uninstall|logs` operates one per-user Oh My Subagents background service from the selected TOML file and its canonical sibling `oms.env`:

- Linux uses a systemd user service;
- macOS uses a current-user LaunchAgent under `~/Library/LaunchAgents`; and
- Windows uses the stable `\Oh My Subagents\Controller` identifier, a current-user Scheduled Task with an interactive-token logon trigger and least-privilege run level.

Native definitions contain only the exact interpreter, stable `-m oh_my_subagents serve` module invocation, selected config path, and bounded service-log path. They contain no provider credential, password, shell wrapper, or elevated/root account. The shared CLI reports definition/startup state plus bounded controller health/readiness rather than presenting systemd and launchd process strings as equivalent truth. Every readiness poll refreshes native state. On systemd, `SubState`, `Result`, `ExecMainCode`, `ExecMainStatus`, and `NRestarts` distinguish ordinary activation from a failed process waiting in `auto-restart`; the latter is **Needs attention**, with `oms service logs --lines 200` as the next action, while `Restart=on-failure` remains enabled. Platform-specific raw state is debug detail.

Controller readiness requires both an active instance reported by the selected native manager and a successful `/readyz` response. A listener alone never proves background-service ownership. Readiness polling tolerates transient native failure during the bounded startup window; Windows uses 30 seconds for cold virtual-environment startup, while systemd and launchd use 3 seconds. Windows registration and runtime inspection use the Task Scheduler 2.0 API; definition comparison preserves exact action/configuration values while treating Task Scheduler's equivalent account-name, SID, and omitted-default XML forms semantically. macOS inspection reads the current `launchctl` job state, process identifier, last exit code, and disabled state. A macOS stop does not complete until launchd confirms that the previous LaunchAgent is unloaded, so a following start bootstraps a replacement instead of targeting a disappearing job. Portable status exposes whether the installed definition is current, and lifecycle start is idempotent for an already active native instance.

Service rendering and replacement are atomic and reject a pre-existing non-regular target. Installation is idempotent. The native manager owns definition and lifecycle operations; a small coordinator owns API readiness and bind-target release. Stop waits for both the native instance and the API listener to disappear, and restart starts the replacement only after that release. Installation and verification must stay isolated, and release proof must not install or mutate a real user's service outside its disposable native lane.

Systemd uninstall removes the user-unit definition only after `systemctl --user disable --now` succeeds. A failed stop preserves the definition and surfaces the native diagnostic so the operator can inspect or retry the installed service instead of being left with a listener and no manageable unit.
