# Built-in runtime tools

Status: Reference

This page owns the exact shipped Task-member and Operator operation catalogs, their schemas, exposure rules, and provider transport boundary.

## Boundary

Oh My Subagents has two separate built-in agent tool catalogs:

- **Task-member tools** are controller operations used by a current Task Dispatch. Codex and Claude turns receive them through a private Dispatch-scoped MCP binding.
- **Operator tools** act on user-facing Workflow and Task product services. They never inherit Task-member authority and are not injected into a Task Dispatch.

The absence of Oh My Subagents-managed external-MCP authoring does not remove either built-in catalog. A Workflow cannot define arbitrary MCP servers or tools, and Oh My Subagents has no external-MCP registry, credential, installation, approval, or replan shape. A managed Member may request inherited visibility of enabled user and project Skills plus configured MCP servers through its provider settings; those provider-native extensions never gain Oh My Subagents controller authority.

For every managed Task Dispatch, the provider must report the Dispatch-bound `oms_node`. Its operation names must equal the exact controller binding, and it must expose no MCP resources or resource templates. Isolated mode admits no other active server. Inherited mode may additionally expose user-home MCP servers after the controller has resolved an effective `full_access` plus network `allow` pair. The adapter records their sanitized server/tool inventory before the first model turn.

## Exact final Task-member catalog

The final catalog contains exactly nine logical operations:

```text
get_current_context
set_work_plan
checkpoint
delegate
add_child
update_child
remove_child
open_human_request       # capability-gated
start_command_run        # capability-gated
```

There is no separate file, note, generic file-reader, wait, finish, retry, release, continuation, child-result, or definition tool.

## Exposure and legality

The managed binding exposes a stable ceiling for one exact Dispatch. Fresh controller state still decides whether a listed call is legal.

| Current Member condition | Tool ceiling |
| --- | --- |
| Every Member | `get_current_context`, `set_work_plan`, `checkpoint`, `add_child` |
| Member with current direct children | add `delegate`, `update_child`, `remove_child` |
| Effective Human Request grant contains at least one kind | add `open_human_request` |
| Effective managed Command Run grant is `allow` | add `start_command_run` |

`add_child` is deliberately available to a Contributor: adding its first child changes its next fresh context to Manager behavior. Task lead is a position, not a separate tool role, and receives no secret completion operation.

The tool ceiling is not completion authority. For example, `checkpoint` stays available for progress while the controller may reject a terminal green outcome until current direct-child participation is satisfied. A Human Request schema narrows its `kind` enum to the exact granted kinds for that binding.

An accepted structural replan closes its source Dispatch, so a change from Contributor to Manager, or the reverse, always receives a fresh binding and fresh tool ceiling on the successor.

## Shared semantic types

`FileReference` is the only generic controller value for pointing another context to a loose file in the Task workspace:

```yaml
FileReference:
  path: workspace-relative regular-file path
  description: optional short purpose
```

The controller validates containment and stores the immutable value on its Assignment, Checkpoint, or Human Request. Task start seeds the root Assignment. Continuations, Result, Activity, context, and product views expose the exact values from those owners rather than persisting copies. Oh My Subagents does not allocate a generic file ID, copy bytes, hash or version content, create a current pointer, or promise that the mutable file still has its earlier bytes. The path may identify an ordinary project file, a working file under `.oms/t_<id>/notes/`, a reviewable loose file under `.oms/t_<id>/artifacts/`, or a Command Run log. Agents open referenced files with native tools and report a missing or changed file honestly.

Storage may normalize these values into owner-scoped ordered rows, but no row is a standalone file resource or receives an independently addressable ID, lifecycle, content body, or lookup API.

All semantic request and success objects are strict closed JSON objects. IDs, enums, text bounds, and nested schemas belong to the tool definition rather than the system prompt.

## Operation contracts

### `get_current_context`

Request:

```yaml
{}
```

Success is one coherent fresh observation:

```yaml
task:
  id: t_7m4k2d9x
  workflow_id: production-feature-delivery
dispatch:
  id: controller Dispatch ID
  attempt_id: controller Attempt ID
  assignment_id: controller Assignment ID
current_member:
  id: current Member ID
  title: optional string
  description: optional string
  instruction: >-
    optional string
  position: optional task_lead
  behavior: manager | contributor
  provider: complete nonsecret effective selection
  effective_capabilities:
    human_request: [input, direction]
    command_run: deny
assignment:
  id: controller Assignment ID
  prompt: complete exact string
  files:
    - path: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x/notes/review.md
      description: optional string
continuation: null or complete typed Continuation
direct_team:
  - id: current direct-child Member ID
    title: optional string
    description: optional string
    instruction: >-
      optional string
    provider: complete nonsecret effective selection
    capabilities:
      human_request: []
      command_run: deny
    participation: required | satisfied
    availability: available | busy
work_plan: optional complete current plan
available_actions: [get_current_context, set_work_plan, checkpoint, ...]
workspace:
  root: /work/acme
  task_directory: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x
  manifest: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x/manifest.md
  workflow_note: optional path
  notes: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x/notes
  artifacts: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x/artifacts
  command_runs: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x/command-runs
observed_at: RFC-3339 UTC timestamp
```

The exact implementation uses shared typed structures with Dispatch input; it does not duplicate a second vocabulary. Current-context JSON returns `continuation: null` for an initial Dispatch. A successor includes the exact trigger source and complete result, not a compact reason plus lookup reference. The response contains no Role, Policy, criteria, consume/produce, request-file ref, managed file operation, structural revision/hash, generic file ID/version, or synthetic initial trigger.

### `set_work_plan`

```yaml
request:
  explanation: optional normalized string
  steps: # 0..9; [] clears
    - step: normalized string
      status: pending | in_progress | completed

success:
  changed: boolean
  plan: null | {explanation?, steps}
```

At most one step is in progress. An identical normalized request is a success with `changed: false`. Private revision, authoring Dispatch, and commit metadata remain support truth, not model-visible success fields.

### `checkpoint`

```yaml
request:
  summary: required nonblank teammate-facing string
  details: optional Markdown string
  files: optional ordered FileReference list
  outcome: optional green | blocked | retry

success:
  checkpoint: {summary, details?, files, outcome?}
  recorded_at: RFC-3339 UTC timestamp
  terminal: boolean
  must_stop: boolean
```

No outcome records progress, returns `terminal: false`, and leaves the Dispatch current. Every present outcome—`green`, `blocked`, or `retry`—commits a terminal Checkpoint and internal accepted boundary together, returns `terminal: true` and `must_stop: true`, and permits no later call or outer-response prose from that Dispatch. Green/blocked close the Assignment; retry closes only the current Dispatch and Attempt, keeps the exact Assignment open, and creates a fresh Attempt when budget remains. Root green/blocked is the exact user Result; root retry is not. There is no separate finish or retry operation.

### `delegate`

```yaml
request:
  assignments: # 1..8, unique current direct-child IDs
    - child_id: Member ID
      prompt: complete nonblank Assignment prompt
      files: optional ordered FileReference list

success:
  accepted: true
  members:
    - child_id: Member ID
  must_stop: true
```

The success means every child Assignment/Attempt/first Dispatch and the parent Wave wait committed atomically; it does not mean providers started or children finished. No Wave ID, mode, schedule, dependency, output declaration, summary, details, criteria, or parent selector is model-visible. The source provider stops immediately. There is no `wait_for_wave` tool: the controller opens the one parent Continuation after the local collect-all join settles.

### Replan operations

Requests are the closed recursive contracts in [Runtime](../architecture/runtime.md):

```yaml
add_child: {child: NewMember}
update_child: {id: existing descendant ID, patch: MemberPatch}
remove_child: {id: existing descendant ID}
```

No request accepts caller/parent ID, expected revision, hash, existing ID on a new Member, reparent/reorder directive, runtime work, arbitrary tool, or external-MCP field. Result families return the relevant created/updated/removed IDs plus fresh direct team, participation, derived behavior, capabilities, and legal actions. Every accepted result contains `must_stop: true`; a separate same-Attempt successor carries the complete committed result after manifest health is current.

### `open_human_request`

```yaml
request:
  request: HumanRequestOpenRequest # exact contract in Runtime

success:
  request_id: controller-issued product ID
  status: open
  must_stop: true
```

Success means the request, typed Attempt wait, and source-Dispatch close committed. It does not mean a human answered or a successor opened.

### `start_command_run`

```yaml
request:
  request: CommandRunStartRequest # exact contract in Runtime

success:
  command_id: c_q3m8y1ka
  status: pending_start
  output_path: .oms/t_7m4k2d9x/command-runs/c_q3m8y1ka/output.log
  must_stop: true
```

Success means command intent, typed Attempt wait, and source-Dispatch close committed. Launch, output, terminal state, and successor opening remain later controller-owned effects. There is no Node command-status/log tool; the continuation carries typed terminal facts and the member reads the visible log with native filesystem tools when needed.

## Transfer boundary rule

The operation descriptor must state whether success:

- leaves the Dispatch current;
- always closes and transfers authority; or
- closes only for a terminal variant.

`delegate`, all three replan operations, `open_human_request`, and `start_command_run` always transfer. `checkpoint` transfers only when outcome is present. After a successful transfer, no further Node call or provider prose is accepted as controller work from that Dispatch.

This metadata belongs beside the operation contract and drives descriptions, prompt action teaching, provider cleanup, and tests. It does not replace the transaction's currentness checks.

## MCP projections and binding

Preserve one private managed Node projection at `/_internal/node/mcp`: semantic arguments only, direct loopback peer, Host/Origin checks, opaque bearer bound to exact Task, Dispatch, and provider-start revision, and a Dispatch-specific exposure ceiling.

Concurrent Attempt lanes receive independent bindings to the same application. The executor must validate Attempt-local current Dispatch authority; it must no longer consult a Flow-wide current pointer. Binding credentials, Task/Dispatch selectors, provider sessions, and controller revisions never enter managed model-visible schemas.

Implementation identities are `oms_node` and `oms-node-managed`.

Every tool provides deterministic ordering, detailed bounded teaching, strict input and output schemas, structured content plus JSON text compatibility, and the shared structured execution failure. Set accurate `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` values; treat them only as client hints, never authorization. Where the pinned SDK exposes MCP task support, mark every Oh My Subagents operation `forbidden`: Oh My Subagents's Dispatch, wait, Wave, Human Request, and Command Run records own resumability. Do not add MCP resources, prompts, elicitation, or protocol-task dependencies.

`tools/list` authenticates and reads fresh authority but does not refresh Node activity. Every admitted call, including reads, accepted no-ops, and normalized post-admission failures, refreshes the exact Dispatch activity revision once. Authentication, malformed schema, stale scope, exposure, and capability denial occur before activity. Every conditional mutation rereads currentness in its short commit transaction.

## Provider integration

The provider-start request carries one ephemeral managed connection for Codex or Claude:

- provider-side enabled-tool lists use the exact current ceiling;
- Claude names use `mcp__oms_node__*`;
- the Codex MCP server key is `oms_node`;
- adapters receive direct Dispatch request strings rather than request-file reads; and
- Attempt-local authority and cleanup for multiple concurrent bindings.

Do not persist the binding or write it into user/provider configuration. A same-Dispatch provider-start retry receives a fresh credential and the same committed request/tool ceiling. Closing a Dispatch invalidates its old binding even when provider stop is delayed or unsupported.

## Operator tools

`workflow_authoring_options` reads stable Workflow fields and configured defaults from controller truth. Its Operator-private result may also contain a transient, complete provider-reported Codex model catalog. The catalog is queried only when this operation is called; unavailable, timed-out, or incomplete provider data is returned as `null`, which directs the Operator to inherit the configured model default. It is not a public Workflow schema field, durable runtime truth, or provider-readiness check.

The complete Operator catalog is defined by [Interfaces, Console, and Operator](console-and-operator.md) and the [Operator conversation contract](operator-conversation-contract.md). It is exactly:

```text
workflow_search
workflow_get
workflow_authoring_options
workflow_draft_create
workflow_draft_edit
workflow_draft_validate
workflow_draft_undo
workflow_draft_discard
workflow_draft_publish
task_search
task_get
task_start
task_control
human_request_respond
command_run_get
command_run_output_read
command_run_cancel
```

Its runtime-facing subset is exactly:

```text
task_search
task_get
task_start
task_control
human_request_respond
command_run_get
command_run_output_read
command_run_cancel
```

`workflow_draft_create` accepts one complete structured JSON Workflow candidate and creates or opens its mutable draft through the existing normalization and authoring services. YAML remains a CLI/text-editor input format; Operator has no separate import tool. `workflow_draft_undo` accepts only an opaque, controller-issued, single-use receipt bound to the exact draft and accepted ETag; neither Operator nor the browser computes an inverse mutation. `workflow_draft_discard` removes only a mutable draft. Published Workflow revisions are immutable and have no Operator delete tool. The Console's separately confirmed **Remove Workflow** product operation clears only active library and draft truth while retaining those immutable revisions for existing Task history.

`workflow_get` is source-pinned and never returns an authored Workflow tree. Its catalog selector returns only metadata, exact current published/draft source references, and bounded immutable history. Its published-revision and exact-draft/ETag selectors return one Member plus ordered direct-child IDs; omission selects the lead, so a model traverses a tree through bounded repeated calls against one unchanged source. Draft mutations expose only compact current-source and accepted-change, validation, Undo, discard, or publication receipts. Exact shapes and stale behavior are owned by the [Operator conversation contract](operator-conversation-contract.md#workflow-projections-and-receipts).

`task_get` defaults to one compact current overview and uses a closed selector for one exact Member, Result, recent Activity item, Human Request, or that Human Request's loose file references. It never returns the complete recursive `TaskView` across the provider boundary. `task_control` and `human_request_respond` return compact accepted-state receipts after calling their shared product services. Exact shapes are owned by the [Operator conversation contract](operator-conversation-contract.md#run-projections-and-receipts).

There is no `artifact_get` or generic `file_get`. `task_get` returns loose `FileReference` values sourced from Assignments, Checkpoints, and Human Requests, embedded in the relevant product message rather than as a standalone file catalog. The Operator receives no arbitrary host-file access or generic file CRUD/content retrieval. UI-specific file opening, if retained, is an authorized product route rather than an Operator agent tool.

The complete Operator catalog has eighteen operations: three Workflow reads, six draft actions, five Task actions, one Human Request action, and three Command Run actions. `task_member_steer` calls the same exact-current product service as Run Studio; it is not a Node tool or provider-native escape hatch.

Every Operator operation is a direct typed leaf call to its existing product service. Provider-facing projections may remove complete aggregates and retain only source-pinned bounded product facts or compact mutation receipts; they do not create another authority or service path. Claude and Codex adapters may expose the executor directly or through an invocation-local private in-process MCP projection. No projection is public, static, authorable, or external-MCP configuration.

Claude uses native structured output. Codex 0.144.4 uses `outputSchema` and `dynamicTools`. When model metadata requires code mode, provider-native `exec` and `wait` are adapter-private transport over only the eighteen Oh My Subagents operations plus inert `update_plan`. The code runtime receives no execution environment, host bindings, filesystem, shell, network, external MCP, module imports, Skills, or Plugins. These provider-native surfaces add no Oh My Subagents or host authority and are not product tools or authorable capabilities. Any wider nested registry or host surface fails availability. The exact claim is eighteen Oh My Subagents product operations, not a literal global model-visible tool count.

Explicit user text or a committed typed answer supplies intent for the action it clearly requests. ETags, controller-issued Undo receipts, current opaque legal-action IDs, strict product schemas, and owning service transactions own currentness and acceptance. Model-visible schemas contain no `confirmed`, proposal, effect, replay, or generic execute field.

Every leaf result passes the provider-neutral 327,680 UTF-16-code-unit size guard owned by the [Operator conversation contract](operator-conversation-contract.md#workflow-projections-and-receipts). The guard compact-serializes once with non-ASCII characters unescaped, fails closed above the bound, and never replays the leaf. Operator-private Workflow and Run projections plus compact mutation receipts keep legal results below that boundary; any post-commit boundary failure remains an uncertain effect and is not retried automatically.

The same provider-neutral boundary validates each Operator request before its leaf handler starts. Malformed envelopes, unknown tool names, and schema-invalid arguments return the shared product-safe `OperationFailure` as a definitive rejection with no attempted mutation. A corrected call is a new request, not an automatic retry of the rejected request. Unknown failures after handler entry and post-handler boundary failures remain uncertain effects and are never replayed automatically. Codex dynamic tools and Claude's invocation-local MCP projection expose identical failure semantics.

## Explicitly absent tools

Do not add:

- `capture_artifact`, `artifact_get`, `file_get`, legacy Artifact list/version/publish/promote, or generic file/reference CRUD;
- `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `write_note`, directory search, or remote-resource access;
- `wait_for_wave`, `wait_for_attempt`, `get_child_result`, or mutable completion counters;
- `return_boundary`, `yield`, `finish`, `retry`, `release_green`, or `release_blocked`;
- `continue`, `resume`, or provider-output completion tools for Task members;
- Operator `ask_user`, `operator_return`, confirmation, effect, retry, or generic import tools;
- Role, Policy, Skill, generic Definition, tool-registry, or external-MCP lookup/mutation;
- provider configuration or capability mutation outside `add_child` and `update_child` Member configuration; or
- one generic `execute_action(any)` escape hatch.

## Required proof

- exact final Node inventory equals the nine names above, in deterministic order, with no stale alias;
- exact final Operator inventory equals its eighteen approved names and has no `artifact_get`;
- the managed Node projection exposes only semantic schemas and derives Task/Dispatch scope from its exact binding;
- Contributor, Manager, capability-granted, denied, stale, and post-replan discovery/call matrices are correct;
- every transfer operation commits authority loss before success returns and duplicate/stale calls cannot mutate a successor;
- nested parallel Attempt bindings cannot cross Task, Attempt, Dispatch, tool ceiling, or provider-start generation;
- Claude and Codex expose the exact eighteen Oh My Subagents operations and the same native `message | ask_user` result contract; provider surfaces expose no host filesystem, shell, network, external MCP, Skill, Plugin, or Oh My Subagents authority outside that catalog, while harmless inert provider-native planning does not expand product authority;
- no MCP protocol Task, elicitation, resource, prompt, or dynamic external-MCP behavior becomes runtime authority;
- native filesystem conformance passes before file-tool removal;
- loose `FileReference` values preserve exact path/description order across project files, notes, artifacts, and command logs but create no generic file ID, body copy, digest, version, current pointer, or Operator content tool; the physical `artifacts/` convention never becomes an Artifact resource; and
- broad searches find no Role/Policy lookup, release/yield, Flow current pointer, request-file ref, managed file tool, old server identity, or raw runtime Operator surface in the final package.

## Protocol basis

Oh My Subagents uses the stable MCP tool primitives: JSON Schema inputs, optional output schemas, structured results with text compatibility, annotations as untrusted hints, and Streamable HTTP with Origin validation, local binding, and authentication. These protocol features describe transport and teaching only; Oh My Subagents controller currentness remains the authority.
